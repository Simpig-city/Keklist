Keklist is an easy to use custom-made black/whitelist for your minecraft server. It's way more customizable than the basic vanilla whitelist and offers way more features. The general idea of this plugin is to have one plugin for managing who can join your server without banning them. Keklist is really lightweight and doesn't use many resources but still full-featured. **Keklist is the only whitelist plugin you'll ever need!**
